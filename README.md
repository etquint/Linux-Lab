<h1>Linux Lab - Manage Authorization</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of screenshots utilizing various skills I learned in Linux to manage authorizations. The following images demonstrate key competencies such as examining file and directory permissions, changing permissions on files, and changing permissions on directories.

<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this scenario, you must examine and manage the permissions on the files in the /home/researcher2/projects directory for the researcher2 user.

The researcher2 user is part of the research_team group.

You must check the permissions for all files in the directory, including any hidden files, to make sure that permissions align with the authorization that should be given. When it doesn't, you must change the permissions.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll check the user and group permissions for all files in the projects directory. Next, you’ll check whether any files have incorrect permissions and change the permissions as needed. Finally, you’ll check the permissions of the /home/researcher2/projects/drafts directory and modify these permissions to remove any unauthorized access.
